# Project2-ETL-With-Carbon-Pollution-Data

The purpose of this project was to get acquainted with the database functions known as extract, transform, and load or ETL.

In the extract stage, we collected the data from kaggle.

In the transform stage, we converted the extracted data from its previous form into the form it needed to be in so that it could be placed into a MySQL database.

In the load stage, we performed the action of writing the data into the target database.
